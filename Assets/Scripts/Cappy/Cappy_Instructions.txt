========== To Record just video or screenshots: ==========

- You only need to import the Cappy script.
- put it on a game object and configure.
- Then you're done!

========== To Record video AND audio: ==========
Because cappy slows down the game to maintain quality video capture, audio playback cannot be recorded in the same step.
Instead, audio ~events~ are recorded, and can be played back and recorded in realtime after the video itself has been recorded.

- import all scripts and scenes
- get SavWav script from https://gist.github.com/darktable/2317063
- put the Sappy script on a game object
- when configuring, enable recordAudioEvents
- in all your scripts, for each piece of audio you want recorded, call Cappy.cappy.RecordAudioClip(audioClipName, audioSourcePosition)
- In the Cappy Audio Playback Scene, make sure all used audioclips are listed by the CappyAudioRecorder component
- After recording video, run the Cappy Audio Playback Scene. It will replay audio clips in realtime, and save a .wav file
- By default, it creates audio for the last recording made, but you can have it make audio for a different recording by specifying the relevant audio data recording file
